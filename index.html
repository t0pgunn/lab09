                    <p>Each city is located in a different hold, and is home to that hold's ruler, or jarl. The five largest cities (major cities) are walled, allowing their maps (or cells as they are called in the Creation Kit) to be treated separately from the main map. Carriages are available for hire outside each major city to transport the player to any other city.</p>

                    <p>Fast traveling to a major city places you just inside its main gate, but each such city also has a keep or palace where the jarl resides, which is a separate fast-travel destination and is listed below. Additionally, Riften has a third fast-travel destination once you have joined the Thieves Guild, namely the entrance to its headquarters.</p>

                    <img src="images/whiterun.jpg">
                    <p>Whiterun is a major city located in the center of Skyrim, to the northwest of the Throat of the World, the highest mountain on the entire continent of Tamriel. The capital of Whiterun Hold, Whiterun's central location makes it the province's major commercial hub. Its central location also makes it a crucial strategic point in the Civil War between the Imperial Legion loyalists and Stormcloak rebels, as control of Whiterun Hold grants access to all the surrounding areas. Initially, Whiterun is nominally aligned with The Empire, but the Jarl, Balgruuf the Greater, seems to care more about the people of Whiterun than either side of the conflict, and so the hold is effectively neutral. Whiterun comprises three districts arranged in tiers and connected by stairways. The Plains District is the lowest and contains all the shops, the city's marketplace, inns, and a few homes as well at the city gates. The Wind District is the main residential area; its more important buildings include the Temple of Kynareth and Jorrvaskr, headquarters of the Companions. The Cloud District is the location of Dragonsreach and is the highest point in Whiterun.</p>

                     <p>Solitude is a major city located in Haafingar on the northwestern shore of Skyrim. In addition to being the largest city in all of Skyrim, it is also the capital of the province and seat of the High King of Skyrim. The entire city is built on a natural arch over the Sea of Ghosts and houses many important buildings, such as the headquarters of the Imperial Legion in Skyrim, the East Empire Company Warehouse, the Blue Palace, and the Bards College.</p>

                    <p>Solitude is a major city located in Haafingar on the northwestern shore of Skyrim. In addition to being the largest city in all of Skyrim, it is also the capital of the province and seat of the High King of Skyrim.

                <div>
                    <p>Solitude was also ruled by King Mantiarco mostly before his marriage to Potema.[3] One of the stranger periods in Solitude's history was under Thoriz Pelagius Septim, who, among other things, was known for stripping nude during speeches.[4] Over time, Solitude became one of the wealthiest cities and counties in Skyrim, and by the end of the Third Era it controlled most of the northern coastline of Skyrim after King Thian married Queen Macalla of Dawnstar.[1] Seeking to expand its influence even farther, Solitude annexed several Imperial fiefs, including the island of Roscrea (all of the fiefs had been ruled by the Empire since Uriel Septim V conquered them in 3E 271).[1] It later began to fund exploration into (and perhaps beyond) the Sea of Ghosts.[1]</p>
                    <p>As Skyrim's capital, Solitude was the seat of the High King before his death. The Thalmor Embassy is also located near Solitude. The Jarl of Solitude is Elisif the Fair, widow to the late High King Torygg. She resides in the Blue Palace, located at the far end of the city.</p>
